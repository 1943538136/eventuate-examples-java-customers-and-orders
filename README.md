This is the Java version of the customers and orders example that I've used in numerous presentations
on developing microservices with event sourcing and CQRS.
The code is built using the Eventuate platform.
It illustrates how to implement an eventually consistent credit limit check using event sourcing.

[Eventuate](http://eventuate.io/) is a application platform for writing transaction microservices.
It provides a simple yet powerful event-driven programming model that is based on event sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS).
Eventuate solves the distributed data management problems inherent in a microservice architecture.
It consists of a scalable, distributed event store server and client libraries for various languages and frameworks including Java, Scala, and the Spring framework. [Learn more.](http://eventuate.io/)
